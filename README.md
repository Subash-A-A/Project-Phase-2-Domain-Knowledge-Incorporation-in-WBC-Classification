# Domain Knowledge Incorporation in WBC Classification

White Blood Cells (WBCs) play a vital role in the human immune system, helping in the
diagnosis of various illnesses and monitoring patient health. This project was conducted
to explore different approaches for the classification of WBCs from blood smear images,
wherein domain knowledge is included in the deep learning model. As traditional
approaches for WBC classification frequently rely on subjective and time-consuming
manual assessment with or without computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), In order to
improve accuracy, this study highlights a novel deep learning technique that combines
neural networks and domain knowledge. By leveraging expert insights on
haematological characteristics, the developed model generates a knowledge vector.
This generated knowledge vector is further used for classification in two different
approaches, the first one being Graph Traversal and the second being Decision Fusion.
As a result, the image is classified into four specific WBC types, which are Neutrophils,
Eosinophils, Monocytes, and Lymphocytes. Further, to ensure that the model
encounters a diverse range of WBCs belonging to all classes, a strategic sampling
technique has been employed before training. This interpretable method has automated
and streamlined WBC classification, and it is hoped to reduce the workload on medical
staff, making it easier to recognise early disease, with the change in normal appearance
of a WBC for better patient care.
